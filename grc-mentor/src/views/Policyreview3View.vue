                          He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly

                         was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. 
                         His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

                            cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
